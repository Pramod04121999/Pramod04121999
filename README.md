### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!!!
I am Zillella Pramod, Graduated as an Electronics Engineer from NIT Bhopal in 2021. I am highly interested in building algorithms which are robust and reduce the processing complexity and time for Medical Image Analysis Applications. The thought process of solving real-life problems and working with neural networks keeps me upâ€Œ â€Œatâ€Œ â€Œnight. It is my passion to solve real life computer vision problems through the implementation and improvement of state-of-the-artâ€Œ â€Œdeepâ€Œ â€Œlearningâ€Œ â€Œmodels.
