### Hi there 👋!!!
I am Zillella Pramod, Graduated as an Electronics Engineer from NIT Bhopal in 2021. I am highly interested in building algorithms which are robust and reduce the processing complexity and time for Medical Image Analysis Applications 🔭. The thought process of solving real-life problems and working with neural networks keeps me up‌ ‌at‌ ‌night. It is my passion to solve real life computer vision problems through the implementation and improvement of state-of-the-art‌ ‌deep‌ ‌learning‌ ‌models.

I appreciate any help/improvements you can give to my pinned repositories. Consider giving my repositories a ⭐️ if you like them.
